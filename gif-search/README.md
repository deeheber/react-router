# Gif Search

I love a good animated gif, so I decided to play around with [giphy's api](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI) to practice pulling data from an external source in a small react web application.

You can view gifs and also search for gifs by topic.

## To Run
1. Clone or downlod the repo files
2. From the `todo-list` directory in a terminal window run `npm install`
3. `npm start` runs the program on `localhost:3000`
