## Hooks

Was pretty inspired by [this talk/demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-QO-KO90iQ) at React Conf 2018 and decided to put together a todo app using Class components an then refactoring them to use hooks instead.

More info about hooks can be found [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html);
