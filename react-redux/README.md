# Scoreboard

A small react/redux application that keeps track of player info and has a stopwatch. Users can view total players/points, adjust the score for each player, view additional info about the players, and start/stop/reset the stopwatch.

Originally built using pure react, but the later commits have redux implemented for state management.

## To Run
1. Clone or downlod the repo files
2. From the `react-redux` directory in a terminal window run `npm install`
3. `npm start` runs the program on `localhost:3000`
