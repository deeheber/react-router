# To do list

The classic todo list approach to experimenting with a new front end framework. The user has the ability to create, read, update, delete, and toggle completion of each task. Built using react and redux.

See live demo [here](https://todolistreact.herokuapp.com/)

Inline `// TODO` comments denote future features which may or may not be coming soon.

## To Run
1. Clone or downlod the repo files
2. From the `todo-list` directory in a terminal window run `npm install`
3. `npm run dev` runs the program on `localhost:3000` with hot module reloading
4. `npm run build` will create a new production build in the `dist` folder
5. `npm start` will start a static server to serve up the files in the `dist` folder
